% Problem 3

set(auto).

list(usable).
% If a number divides another number, then it is smaller than that number.
% (Example: 6 divides 24, so 6 is smaller than 24)
-divides(x, y) | x < y.

% A number is smaller than its successor.
% (Example: 14 is smaller than 15)
x < succ(x).

% No number is less than itself.
% (Example: 5 is not less than 5)
-(x < x). 

% Less than is transitive.
% (Example: 13 < 14 and 14 < 15.  Therefore 13 < 15)
% -(x < y) | -(y < z) | x == y | y == z | x == z | x < z.
-(x < y) | -(y < z) | (x < z).

% If a number divides another number, then it does not divide the successor
% of the number.
% (Example: 2 divides 14, therefore 2 does not divide 15)
-divides(x, y) | -divides(x, succ(y)).

% If a number is not prime, then some prime number divides it.
% (Example: 15 is not prime, so 3 divides 15)
prime(y) | divides(prime(x), y).

end_of_list.

list(sos).
% Prove:  There exists no number that is a product of all the primes.
divides(prime(x), prime(y)).
